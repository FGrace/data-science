Introduction:
Five steps in cleaning this data set is described as below:
First, all similar dataset is combined by rbind() function.
Second,only the column names with mean or std are taken from the original dataset. And the features.txt is read into R to give the right column names for this subset dataset.
Third, we substitute ID numbers of activities with activity names. 
Fourth, cbind is used to combine activities,subject and all other variables in data
Finally,a tidy dataset with all averages for each subject and activity is obtained. The file name is average_alldata.txt and uploaded to the repository as well.

Variables:
x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test,subject_train,subject_test contain data from original files.
x_all,y_all,subject_all are the merged dataset for the purpose of analysis
features contain the variable names for x_all, while features_mean_std only contain variable names including mean or std.
x_mean_std is the subset data of x_all, only containing columns corresponding to mean or standard deviation.
alldata merges x_mean_std,y_all and subject_all
average_alldata is the tidy dataset containing the averages for each subject and activity type
